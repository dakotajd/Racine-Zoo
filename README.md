# Racine Zoo

The Racine Zoo provides a fun environment for all ages through many diverse animal exhibits throughout the grounds. The Zoo contacted Parkside to help assist in building a more engaging experience for zoo-goers. The purpose of the app is to serve as a companion as a person makes their way around the Zoo. Along with being informational, the app provides a number of features to help make the user's Zoo experience the first of many to remember.

## Features

*   A modern and functional interface
*   A full list of animals along with pictures, descriptions, facts, locations, etc for each
*   Graphic and satellite maps with popular locations pinned on the map
*   Pictures and descriptions for each location pinned on the map
*   A full list of zoo events complete with times/dates, pictures, descriptions, and sign up links
*   The ability to add zoo events to your calendar to schedule reminders and sync them across all of your devices
*   An about page with information for parking, admission, etc.
*   The ability to go on a beacon guided tour*

### *Beacon Guided Tour

One of the key features of the app is the ability to go on a beacon guided tour. With the help of bluetooth beacons (devices that emit a bluetooth signal) placed at each animal location in the zoo, users can opt in to receiving notifications when they near an exhibit. These notifications, when activated, will open the user to the animal's detail page to show them all of the relevant information for the app. This function happens automatically if the device is already unlocked/awake. The beacon guided tour puts the information provided at each exhibit on the signs in the palm of a user's hand.

## Project Details

*   Android version compatibility: SDK 16+ (Android 4.1 - 7.1)
*   Major technologies used: Android Support Library, Glide, Google Maps API, Android Beacon Library, SubsamplingImageView

The app was developed for a Software Engineering II class in the timeframe of February 2017 - May 2017 with a team of 3 other students. The app was also later adapted as a UW-Parkside Appfactory project.
